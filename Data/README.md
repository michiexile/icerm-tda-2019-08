The data set is a 32-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) data set, consisting of protein expression levels for n = 265,627 cells, p = 32 protein markers (dimensions), and k = 14 manually gated cell populations (clusters), from h = 2 individuals. Cluster labels are available for 39% (104,184) of the cells.

This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

1.3 Million Brain Cell Dataset, which is, to date, the largest dataset published in the single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) field. Using the Chromium™ Single Cell 3’ Solution (v2 Chemistry), we were able to sequence and profile 1,308,421 individual cells from embryonic mice brains.

This is a 39-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) data set, consisting of expression levels of 39 surface marker proteins. Cell population labels are available for 24 manually gated populations. Manually gated cell population labels were provided by the original authors. This dataset contains cells from 10 replicate bone marrow samples from C57BL/6J mice (i.e. samples from 10 different mice). Mass cytometry (CyTOF) dataset from Samusik et al. (2016), containing 39 dimensions (surface protein markers). Manually gated cell population labels are available for 24 populations. This dataset contains cells from 10 replicate bone marrow samples from C57BL/6J mice (i.e. samples from 10 different mice). This dataset can be used to benchmark clustering algorithms.
